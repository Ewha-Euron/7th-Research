- **Key Focus**: This paper presents U-Net, a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation. The architecture is characterized by a symmetric U-shaped structure, consisting of a contracting path to capture context and an expansive path to enable precise localization. U-Net relies heavily on data augmentation, including elastic deformations, to maximize the utility of limited annotated datasets. It employs weighted loss functions to address challenges such as separating touching objects of the same class. The network achieves state-of-the-art performance in various biomedical tasks, including ISBI 2012 EM segmentation and ISBI 2015 cell tracking challenges, significantly outperforming previous methods. The implementation is efficient, processing a 512x512 image in under a second on a modern GPU.
