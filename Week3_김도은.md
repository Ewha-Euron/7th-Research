- **Key Focus**: This paper presents a method for high-quality image synthesis using diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. It demonstrates that diffusion models, when trained using a weighted variational bound and incorporating connections to denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, can generate high-quality samples that are competitive with state-of-the-art generative models. The paper discusses parameterization, objective simplifications, and the practical implementation of these models, achieving an Inception score of 9.46 and a FID score of 3.17 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sample quality comparable to ProgressiveGAN on 256x256 LSUN datasets.
