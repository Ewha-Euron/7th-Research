- **Key Focus**: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input, specifically raw pixels from Atari 2600 games. Using a variant of Q-learning with experience replay, the model achieves competitive performance across various Atari games without hand-crafted features or game-specific modifications. The method outperforms prior approaches in six of seven tested games, achieving scores comparable to or surpassing human expert levels in some instances. The approach showcases the efficacy of deep Q-networks (DQN) in reinforcement learning applications involving high-dimensional inputs.
